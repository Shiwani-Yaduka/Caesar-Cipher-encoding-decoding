The Caesar cipher is a simple and well-known encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate with his officials. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The number of positions to shift is called the "key."

### Encoding with the Caesar Cipher

1. **Choose a Key**: Determine the number of positions each letter will be shifted. For example, if the key is 3, each letter will be shifted three places forward in the alphabet.
   
2. **Shift the Letters**: For each letter in the plaintext:
   - Convert the letter to its corresponding number (A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25).
   - Add the key to this number.
   - If the result exceeds 25, wrap around by subtracting 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet).
   - Convert the new number back to a letter.

3. **Construct the Ciphertext**: Combine all the shifted letters to form the ciphertext.

**Example**: Encrypting "HELLO" with a key of 3:
- H (7) → K (10)
- E (4) → H (7)
- L (11) → O (14)
- L (11) → O (14)
- O (14) → R (17)

The ciphertext is "KHOOR".

### Decoding with the Caesar Cipher

1. **Choose the Same Key**: Use the same key that was used for encoding.
   
2. **Reverse the Shift**: For each letter in the ciphertext:
   - Convert the letter to its corresponding number.
   - Subtract the key from this number.
   - If the result is negative, wrap around by adding 26.
   - Convert the new number back to a letter.

3. **Construct the Plaintext**: Combine all the shifted letters to form the original plaintext.

**Example**: Decrypting "KHOOR" with a key of 3:
- K (10) → H (7)
- H (7) → E (4)
- O (14) → L (11)
- O (14) → L (11)
- R (17) → O (14)

The plaintext is "HELLO".

### Properties and Security

- **Simplicity**: The Caesar cipher is extremely simple to implement and understand.
- **Vulnerability**: Due to its simplicity, it is also very insecure. With only 25 possible keys (for the English alphabet), it is vulnerable to brute force attacks. Frequency analysis can also easily break it because it does not mask the frequency of letters in the plaintext.
- **Modern Usage**: While not used for serious encryption purposes, the Caesar cipher is often used for educational purposes and as a simple introduction to cryptography.
